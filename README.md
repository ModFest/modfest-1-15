**ModFest 1.15** was a mod development jam that ran from **March 15th** through **April 5th, 2020**.

All participants were invited to build **in-game showcases** for their mods on a server later made public between **April 12th** and **May 1st, 2020**!

**Key Features**:
- Witness the dawn of 39 mods, including classics like **Campanion**, **Gravestones**, and **YUNG's Better Mineshafts**!
- Explore authentic vanilla terrain with mod "booths" scattered left, right, and above!
- Traverse a map covered in rope bridges, audio cables, and blood-red waters!
- Become confused at your own inventory functions!
- Realize there are at least 5 secrets to discover!

**Have fun!**
